Welcome to the "Noteskin Workshop" for "DanceGroove", a DDR style noteskin, but with a more modern feature set. This noteskin features all new high resolution assets, and will look great even on 4k displays. Just about every aspect of the noteskin can be color customized, and for the arrows themselves there are over eighty variations! All color customization options cab be browsed in the "previews" folder.

Customization options

-----------------------------------Explosions-----------------------------------

Both hold and tap explosions can be customized. 

Tap explosions can be customized to different judgements. By default it comes with ITG, but there are options for things like Rainbowmatic and Waterfall and a few others. There is also an "all white" option if you prefer your tap explosions to be color neutral. Tap explosions come in 3 variants per color set: Spark (X shaped like a traditional DDR tap explosion), Glow (more like the ITG Cel/Metal noteskin tap explosions) and Minimal (similar to glow but with a smaller area). Here is a preview example for the default "ITG" tap explosion set.

Hold explosions can be color customized to many different color options and also come in the same 3 variations as tap explosions (Spark, Glow, and Minimal). Here is a preview example of the purple hold explosions.
