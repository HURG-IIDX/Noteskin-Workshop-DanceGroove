(Scroll down to the bottom for Customization Instructions!) Welcome to the "Noteskin Workshop" for "DanceGroove", a DDR style noteskin with a modern feature set. This noteskin features all new high resolution assets, and will look great even on 4k displays. Just about every aspect of the noteskin can be customized. All customization options have preview images that can be browsed in the "previews" folder. Please note that preview images are almost entirely presented at a lower resolution than the actual assets of the noteskin to help reduce download size.

Customization options:

-----------------------------------Arrows-----------------------------------

There are a lot of arrow customization options (over eighty!). By default the skin uses the "ITG" arrow set. In the previews folder there are animated GIF previews of every arrow option except for those that have no animation, such as "Dev Cel", those are presented as static PNG images. Every arrow preview image has labels for each quantization. As an example, here is the preview image for the default ITG arrow set.

This noteskin also supports lifts. Lifts appear the same and are visually distinct regardless of what arrow set you use. Here is a preview image of how lift arrows appear in game

-----------------------------------Explosions-----------------------------------

Both hold and tap explosions can be customized. 

Tap explosions can be customized to different match different judgement color sets. By default it comes with the "ITG" Spark color set, but there are options for things like Rainbowmatic and Waterfall and a few others. There is also an "all white" option if you prefer your tap explosions to be color neutral. Tap explosions come in 3 variants per color set: Spark (X shaped like a traditional DDR tap explosion), Glow (more like the ITG Cel/Metal noteskin tap explosions) and Minimal (similar to glow but with a smaller area). As an exmple, here is a preview example for the "ITG" tap explosion set (by default the skin uses the ITG Spark set).

Hold explosions can be color customized to many different color options and also come in the same 3 variations as tap explosions (Spark, Glow, and Minimal). By default the skin uses the "White" minimal color option. As an example, here is a preview image of the "Purple" hold explosions.

-----------------------------------Holds and Rolls-----------------------------------

Holds and rolls (active and inactive) can be color customized. Every color option has a standard and shadow version. Feel free to mix and match different options! By default the noteskin uses the "white" color options for both holds and rolls. As an example, here are preview images for the "Vapor" normal and shadow color options.

-----------------------------------Mines-----------------------------------

Mines can be color customized, and for every color option there are four different types of mine graphic styles, ITG, Note, X, and Dot. In game is just the graphic rotating. By default the skin uses the ITG "Red" color option. As an example, here is the preview image for the "Red" mine options.

-----------------------------------Receptors-----------------------------------

Receptors can be color customized and there are two variations of receptors, Classic (similar to normal DDR noteskins with a hollow center and frame that blinks on beat) and Center Glow (Center area of arrow glow blinks on beat). By default the noteskin uses the "gray" center glow option. As an example, here are the "Ocean" color preview images for both Classic and Center Glow receptors.

Customization Instructions:

First extract the "DanceGroove - Workshop" folder and place it in your Stepmania install in your noteskins>dance folder. This is the noteskin you will be using as a base for customization. Feel free to rename it as this will be something you can make your own!

In the "Customizations" folder you will find the files needed to change the colors of the different aspects of the noteskin. Each aspect has numerous color options. Within each color folder you will find the .PNG files needed to change the color of the noteskin aspect. Place those in your "DanceGroove - Workshop" (or whatever you renamed it to if you did) and replace the existing .PNG files.

For example, if you wanted purple holds, you would go to the Customizations>Holds>Purple folder, and drag those .PNG files into the noteskin's folder.
