Welcome to the "Noteskin Workshop" for "DanceGroove", a DDR style noteskin, but with a more modern feature set. This noteskin features all new high resolution assets, and will look great even on 4k displays. Just about every aspect of the noteskin can be color customized, and for the arrows themselves there are over eighty variations! All color customization options cab be browsed in the "previews" folder.

Customization options

-----------------------------------Explosions-----------------------------------

Both hold and tap explosions can be customized. 

Tap explosions can be customized to different judgements. By default it comes with ITG, but there are options for things like Rainbowmatic and Waterfall and a few others. There is also an "all white" option if you prefer your tap explosions to be color neutral. Tap explosions come in 3 variants per color set: Spark (X shaped like a traditional DDR tap explosion), Glow (more like the ITG Cel/Metal noteskin tap explosions) and Minimal (similar to glow but with a smaller area). Here is a preview example for the "ITG" tap explosion set (by default the skin uses the ITG Spark set).

Hold explosions can be color customized to many different color options and also come in the same 3 variations as tap explosions (Spark, Glow, and Minimal). By default the skin uses the "White" minimal color option. As an example, here is a preview image of the "Purple" hold explosions.

-----------------------------------Holds and Rolls-----------------------------------

Holds and rolls (active and inactive) can be color customized. Every color option has a standard and shadow version. Feel free to mix and match different options! By default the noteskin uses the "white" color options for both holds and rolls. As an example, here are preview examples for the "Vapor" normal and shadow color options.

-----------------------------------Mines-----------------------------------

Mines can be color customized, and for every color option there are four different types of mine graphic styles, ITG, Note, X, and Dot. In game is just the graphic rotating. By default the skin uses the ITG "Red" color option. As an example, here is the preview image for the "Red" hold explosions.

-----------------------------------Receptors-----------------------------------

Receptors can be color customized and there are two variations of receptors, Classic (similar to normal DDR noteskins with a hollow center and frame that blinks on beat) and Center Glow (Center area of arrow glow blinks on beat). By default the noteskin uses the "gray" center glow option. As an example, here are the "Ocean" color preview images for both Classic and Center Glow receptors.
